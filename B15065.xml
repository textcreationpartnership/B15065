            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Brittle is that greatnes that fadeth in a moment, and vaine the ioy that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wisely lost, hee that hath a sodaine rise and can wisely stand, is a most happy Worldling, but he that forgets himselfe on the Pinacle of prosperity is besotted with arrogancy: therefore let him that hunts for honors in Princes Courts, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in an euen passage, for dangerous are the proceedings and busines of a States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, take this for an example: suppose that a yong man from the lowest ebbe of worldly chance haue the aduancement of greatnes laid vppon his shoulders, will it not for a time seeme a heauy burthen, and a great trouble to his new transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fortunes? will not the pride of his heart swell to a full Sea; euen ready to burst ouer the bankes of his Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer?

All you that haue your hearts pierced with sad considerations, take this for a remembrance of greefe, that is, That when a Woman of noble Parentage, placed on the mountaine of smiling chance, hauing the dignity of Greatnesse shining on her fore-head, should humble her selfe to base conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, giuing her whole mind to malicious hatred, secret consents of iniquity, selfe-will and wicked proceedings, neuer pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
<pb facs="tcp:178280:9"/> till the end of damned performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Oh: was not this Woman created for a deepe sorrow to her Aliance, a great greefe vnto her Country, and a foule staine vnto her owne reputation? Is it not also a lamentable example, for a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of good birth and calling, Placed in dignity, in high office and charge for his Country, to giue way by consent to a bloody stratagem, and for feare of the displeasures of Greatnes intangles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the snares of reproch? will not this also be a continuall remembrance to his posterity, and a barre of disgrace branding the coate Armes of his house, to haue the common course of Iustice passe vppon him in the eye of the multitude. Is it not also great pitty that for want of grace some of a seruile (yet an obseruing condition) should from the golden meane of low estate wait at the elbow of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and bring fuell to their fire of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb facs="tcp:178280:9"/> wherein at the length they themselues are likewise consumed. Oh! wherefore should simplicity thus blind vp their eyes of vnderstanding, to bee thus the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of such dangerous drifts, that aymes at nothing but grudge and mallice? if with <hi>Solons</hi> saying they had sealed vp their hearts, <hi>Remember the end,</hi> this had neuer beene: then how are they led away with amisse, that hauing the guifts of art and experience, the secrets of the simples of Phisicke, ordained by God for mans good vse, should by the Diuell and them be conuerted thus to malignant purposes if the feare of God had shined in their hearts, it would haue beene a light to haue led them from all those darke practises, which hath now spotted the foreheads of their reputations with the marks of black infamy, shame cannot choose but bee the reward of such enterprisers, that for the fauours of Greatnes, will dip their hands
<pb facs="tcp:178280:10"/> in the blood of Innocents, and euen as it were worke against nature: Oh more then sauage minded Crreatures in the very deepenesse of your blacke and bloody immaginations, (imboldened by whomsoeuer) this might haue been your <hi>Memento,</hi> in which I conclude, that strange and wonderfull are Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that in these fore-passed strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems haue shined in great glory, say you then, that blood innocently shed is layd vp in Heauens Treasury, not one droppe of it can bee lost, but lent out to Vsury: water poured forth, sinkes downe quietly into the earth, but blood spilt on the ground, sprinkles vp to the Firmament, Murder is wide mouthed, and will not let God rest till hee grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, not onely the blood of the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, but the soule of the innocent ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his throne, crying out and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claining for Iustice, which (the Lord bee

            <p>VVIth <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> I kneele (O <hi>Iesus</hi>) at thy feete, which I wash with the teares of a peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall bleeding heart, dry them vp againe with the Sighes of my afflicted Soule, O my sweet Sauiour what pretious bloud didst thou pay in ransome to fetch my Soule out of euerlasting Death and Hell? And how (for a golden bribe) haue I sold that loue of thine, and my owne Saluation? I am vndone for euer, for fince I could speake the Name of God, or his blessed Sonne, I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner speake or doe any thing that was worthy of Heauen. What haue I not beene, that in the world is Euell, and what is now in me, that I dare call Good? My youth was Licentious, my Age wicked, my Latter daies offensiue and odious to God and Man. Yet notwithstanding (Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father) Since my Repentant Soule comes crying to Thee for Mercy, as before my Sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#pdcc" extent="1 letter">

            <p>GOD of my Soule and Body, haue mercy vpon mee: the one I haue cast way by my folly, &amp; the other is likely to perish in thy Fury, vnlesse in thy great mercy thou Saue it. My Sinnes are deepe Seas to drowne mee; I am swallowed vp in the bottomles Gulph of my owne transgressions. With <hi>Gaine</hi> I haue beene a Murderer, and with <hi>Iudas</hi> √† Betrayer of t he Innocent. My body is a Slaue to Sathan, and my wretched Soule is deuowred vp by Hell. Black haue bin my thoughts, and blacker, are my deeds. I haue beene the Diuells instrument, and am now become the Scome of Men, a Serpent vpon earth, and an Out-cast from Heauen.
